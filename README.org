** Buildpacks

- haxe on scalingo is built with [[https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/deployment/buildpacks/custom][custom buildpack]]

Test build with:
#+begin_src shell :eval no
  docker run --pull always --rm -ti -e STACK=scalingo-20 \
         -v $PWD:/buildpack \
         -v $PWD/../app/:/build scalingo/scalingo-20:latest bash  
#+end_src

Note that a small profile script is required to merge runtime
environement variables to the =config.xml= file.

*** Buildpack github token

The custom buildpack is stored in a private repo. The
buildpack URL must include a valid github token (aka =PAT=).

#+begin_example
BUILDPACK_URL=https://<token>@github.com/CagetteNet/neko-scalingo-buildpack.git#main
#+end_example
